# Formulating Good Research Questions #

1. Not an data analysis question.  The 1994 rate of Juvenile Delinquency is a official statistic that can be found in the library or Google.

2. Very broad data analysis question.  Unlikely to be easily answered by a single data anlysis.  Requires too much political input and debate.

3. Much more reasonable data analysis question.  Given the right data set we can run analysis to at least see if education is correlated with better Juvenile Delinquent outcomes.

4. ATT should know ask them.  Not an appropriate data analysis question.

5. This is a good data analysis question.  Given we have enough info on consumers and their telecom choices.

6. This needs to be narrowed down to factors that we have data on much like the previous question.

7. Not sure this is a good data analysis question.  By reconstruction, we know that the O-rings failed by being exposed to cold weather before the launch.  We could make this a data analysis question if we change it to be about an experiment with o-rings being exposed to different temperatures.

8. This is a good genomics data analysis question.  There is lots of data on individuals and whether they get breast cancer.

9. Given the availability of the right data and a long enough period of time, this is a good data research question.  The term "Better" could be more closely defined.

10. Only Google knows in detail. Some general ideas have been published.  But we will not be able to answer this without spying on Google.
